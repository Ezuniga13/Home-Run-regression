# Home-run-regression

For this project I scraped the website [Sports-Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com) using Selenium and Beautiful Soup. I took historical batting statistics throughout the years from 1960 to 2018. After cleaning the data, I sorted it and grouped the results by player and ran a stats model to get coefficients in order to get an idea of what featurs would be helpful inorder to preditct home-runs. Oddly enough, a high strikeout counts is positively correlated with home-runs.

## Cars
We've all seen the image or video of a 'high profile' ball player, typically a home-run hitter, arriving to the stadium in an expensive sports car. But did you know that most players of that caliber or any major league ball player didn't start off driving luxury cars? I compiled this txt file of [cars that were previously owned by minor league players](https://github.com/Ezuniga13/Home-Run-regression/blob/main/minor-league-cars.txt), not to chide anyone in particular, but as a gentle reminder for their public and themselves of their humble beginngs. <br>

## Pickled Data
This is just file where a pickled the data instead of waiting for the function that I built to scrape the webpage. [Pickled Data](https://github.com/Ezuniga13/Home-Run-regression/blob/main/dummy.pkl)

## Bronx Bombers Code
Here is the main jupyter notebook page where I used python and other techs to scrape the web, manipulate the data and build a prediction model using linear regression. [Bronx Bombers Code](https://github.com/Ezuniga13/Home-Run-regression/blob/main/Bronx%20Bombers.ipynb)
