# Home-run-regression

<p> For this project I scraped the website **[Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/)** using Selenium and Beautiful Soup. I took historical batting statistics throughout the years from 1960 to 2018. After cleaning the data, I sorted it and grouped the results by player and ran a stats model to get coefficients in order to get an idea of what featurs would be helpful inorder to preditct home-runs. Oddly enough, a high strikeout counts is positively correlated with home-runs.<p/>
